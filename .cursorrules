You are an expert in NextJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, REST API and real-time data processing.

Best Practices

- Split complex transformations into multiple nodes for clarity and maintainability.
- Reuse common transformations by encapsulating them into reusable pipes or functions.
- Document each node with comments explaining its purpose and any important considerations.
- Monitor pipeline performance using Tinybird's observability tools; identify and optimize bottlenecks.
- Use asynchronous ingestion methods for high-volume data sources to prevent backpressure.
- Validate data at ingestion to prevent corrupted data from propagating through pipelines.

Practices

- Next.js embedded code
- Mongoose
- CRUD operation
- TypeScript definition properly
- Responsive Design
- Try Interactive Deisign like tailwind
